WOOD-\\n\\nCBOFT\\'S PATENT SECTION TAPPET.\\n\\nTHE Patent Tappet possesses the following advan-\\n\\ntages : — The plates of the Section Tappet are\\n\\nparallel to each other, whereby a less amount of friction\\nis produced against them by the treadle stud and bowls,\\nthan by the common plates. The jiggers or parts in\\nrelief, which give motion to the bowls, are set out on a\\ngeometrical principle, so that the shafts rise and fall\\nequal distances in equal times. By these means the\\nblow of the reed is borne by each warp thread equally,\\nwhether the weft be struck home with the shed open,\\nshut, or crossed. The consequence is, that fewer threads\\nare broken, and the healds are less worn.\\n\\nThis Tappet will also weave weaker yarn than the\\n\\nordinary one, and it is now generally applied to looms\\nfor weaving cotton, silk, linen, and woollen. One\\nTappet, of any number to the round, will weave all\\npatterns capable of being woven by that number of\\npicks.\\n\\nPatent sections may be had to weave the following\\n\\nnumbers of picks, viz., 3. 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 14, 15,16,\\n17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28, 32, 36, 48, and 56 ; with suit-\\nable dwells for making twills, pillows, velveteens, sat-\\nteens, jeanets, cords, tabbys, velvets, dimities, muslin\\nspots, fancy silks, satins, linen and cotton drills, can-\\ntoons, gambroons, or any description of warp patterns.\\n\\nJ. Crowley and Co. have in their employment Mr.\\n\\nYoung, a pattern designer ; manufacturers sending a\\npiece of woven cloth, can have any number of Tappets\\nsent, suitable for making the article required.\\n\\nN.B. — Every description of Tappet Wheels, Pinions,\\n\\nJacks, Treadles, Bowls, and Bolts; Annealed Castings;\\nMule and Throstle Wharves, &c. — 4, Cannon Street,\\nHanging Ditch, Manchester.\\n\\nDB. YOUNG\\'S URETHRIC MIXTURE,\\n\\nA SPEEDY AND EFFECTUAL CORE\\n\\nFor Stricture, Stone, Gravel, and all Diseases of the\\n\\nKidneys and Bladder.\\n\\nTHE efficacy of this Medicine in the above com-\\n\\nplaints has been long proved by its unparalleled\\n\\nsuccess in a practice of many years\\' standing, and has\\ninduced the present proprietor to make it more gene-\\nrally known. Its object is to supersede the necessity\\nof using the Bougie, which from frequent use, makes\\nthe passage more susceptible of disease, and frequently\\nbrings on a confirmed case of Diseased Prostrate Gland ;\\nit quickly removes all soreness, quiets irritation, and\\nallay, the inflammation that invariably attends these\\npainful diseases.\\n\\nSTONE, GRAVEL, See.\\n\\nIn these case, (perhaps the most painful that the hu-\\n\\nman frame is subject to) the Mixture will be found of\\nthe utmost efficacy ; it gently acts on the Kidneys, pro-\\nducing a greater flow by the Urether to the Bladder,\\nand there forming a complete solution, it not only dis-\\nsolves and takes up any Sediment or Gravel, but also\\ntends to assist the Glands in dispelling any small par-\\nticle of Stone that may remain in the Bladder.\\n\\nSold, in bottles, at 2s. 9d., 4s. 6d., and lis. each, by\\n\\nJ. SANGER, 150, Oxford-street, London ; and by\\nSLATER, PARKINSON, WOOD, Blackburn; Brad-\\nbury, Hudsmith, Reynolds, Scow-croft, Warburton,\\nBolton; Warburton, Chowbcnt ; Barnes, Cameron, Ed-\\nmondson, Raw, Sharpies, Preston; Clarke, Carrnthers,\\nJackson, Milner, Whimpray, Wilson, Lancaster; and\\nall respectable Medicine Venders thronghout the\\ncountry.\\n\\nAS SUPPLIED _) _3_^K__i_. TOTHE\\n\\nCaptain Pidding\\'s Mowqua\\'s Mixture Tea\\nIS AN ADMIXTURE OF 40 RARE BLACK TEAS,\\nPRODUCED on as manydifferent Plantations, each Tea differ\\n\\ning from the rest, and possessing a flavour, a fragrance or\\n\\nstrength, peculiar to itself. Blended together in the proper pro-\\nportions, they comprise all that is desirable in Tea. This dis-\\ncovery was not the effect of chance, but of many great advan-\\ntages united in one individual, and the result of numerous\\nexperiment* and the most minute analysis. For another to\\nproduce the same result, he must possess equal .kill, the same\\ndiscriminating taste, equal power of procuring the 40 various\\nTeas required, and know the exact proportions of each kind\\nused, — and though he may never once bave visited China, he\\nmust have had equal opportunities of securing to himself its\\nproductions : with one, who, like Capt. Pidding, has spent years\\nthere in acquiring these advantages, and to whom alone How-\\nqua—years before his death — imparted at Canton, the secret of\\ncompounding his Mixture.\\n\\nYet there are upwards 500 retailers pretending to sell Tea,\\n\\nthey call \" Howqua\\'s Mixture\"— each mixture differing from all\\nthe others. Now, as there can be but one real \" Howqua\\'s\\nMixture,\" it follows that, as 500 different medleys are offered —\\n499 must be spurious. The 499 counterfeits are so many evi-\\ndences of the superiority of the one gekuike. And it would\\nbe absurd to suppose that Captain Pidding, with advantages,\\nthe result of eight voyages made to China, and 5 years spent\\nin that country, would be .0 silly — even were it possible — as to\\nyield them up to 500 other., or impart to tbem so valuable a\\nsecret.\\n\\nThe very great celebrity this Tea has acquired having tempted\\n\\nmany unprincipled persons to give (.imilar, or nearly similar\\ntitles to their own spurious mixtures, to guard against such\\nimposition, purchasers should observe that\\n\\n\"THE SIGNATURE THUS,\"\\n\\nHon. Company\\'s Service, is on every genuine package.\\n\\nTo those who drink Green Tea, \"Capt.

They so perfectly\\nresemble natural teeth, as not to be distinguished from the ori-\\nginals, by the closest observer. They will never change colour\\nor decay, and will be found superior to any teeth ever before\\nused. This method does not require the extraction of roots, or\\nany painful operation, and will support and preserve the teeth\\nthat are loose, and is guaranteed to restore articulation and mas-\\ntication. The invention deserves the notice of the scientific,\\nand is of importance to many persons, and those who are inte-\\nrested in it, cannot do better than avail themselves of Mr. How-\\naril\\'s skill, as a Dentist.

I had tried\\ndoctoring and medicines of every kind, but all to no avail, in-\\ndeed I daily got worse, and felt that I must shortly die. From\\nseeing your remedies advertised in the paper I take in, I thought\\nI would give them a trial. I did so. I rubbed the Ointment\\nin as directed, and kept cabbage leaves to the parts thickly-\\nspread with it, and took the Pills night and, morning. In three\\nweeks 1 was enabled to walk about for an hour or two in the\\nTtay-wtth a stfck, anrTfn sevVrf -vreeYs f mold gw arrywTiere wtrri-\\nout one. lam now, by the blessing of God and your medicines,\\nquite well, and have been attending to my business for more\\nthan seven months, without any symptoms of the return of my\\nold complaint.\\n\\nBesides my case of Rheumatic Gout, I have lately had proof\\n\\nthat your Pills and Ointment will heal any old wound or ulcer,\\nas a married woman, living near me, had had a bad leg for four\\nyears, which no one could cure, and I gave her some of your\\nPills and Ointment, which soundly healed it when nothing else\\nwould do it. For your information I had the honour to serve\\nmy country for twenty-live years in the first regiment of Life\\nGuards, and was eighteen years a Corporal. I was two years in\\nthe Peninsula War, and was at the Battle of Waterloo. I was\\ndischarged with a pension on the 2nd September, 1833. The\\nCommanding Officer at the time, was Colonel Lygon, who is\\nnow a General.

I was frequently unable to work ; and the\\npain and agony 1 often endured no one can tell. My leg is now\\nas sound as ever it was in my life by means of your Pills and\\nOintment, which I purchased from Mr. I.

In\\ndispair ; I returned home to impart the melancholy news to my\\nwife, intending to submit to the operation, it was then a thought\\nstruck rae to try your valuable Ointment and Pills, which I did,\\nand was by their means in three weeks enabled to resume my\\nusual occupation, and at this time my toes are perfectly cured.\\n\\nl.Signed) OLIVER SMITH JENKINS.\\n\\nSold by the Proprietor, 244, Strand, (near Temple Bar),\\n\\nLondon, and by all respectable Venders of Patent Medicines\\nthroughout the civilized World, in Pots and Boxes, Is. lid.,\\n2s. t»d., 4s.
